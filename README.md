Hackathon (Disaster management)

EYE-360 is an app proposed by us which is largely based on simulation of an earthquakeâ€™s approach to its users along with an aim to shorten the gap between the help seekers and providers.
 
This is our first attempt to make an app. 
Features:-
- Real time detection of earthquakes using networks of smartphones
- Earthquake warning  in advance 
- Automatic e-mails and SMS with your coordinates sent when an earthquake is detected in real time ( Selection of contacts being provided   during peacetime )
- Earthquake data from national and international seismic networks
- Earthquake history 2000-2018
- Chatrooms for exchanging info during earthquakes
- Earthquake notifications through voice synthesizer
- Earthquake warning in case of vibrations detected by your smartphone
- Priority in chat during quake emergencies
- Provision of a navigation based communication system between help seekers and providers.

We aim at developing a smartphone-based earthquake early warning system which is able to detect earthquakes in real time and to alert the population in advance. Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediately alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at a finite speed (from 5 to 10 km/s) it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. 

The EYE-360 app allows you to receive the real time alerts of the earthquakes detected by the network, to manually report an earthquake you felt and to chat with other people during an earthquake emergency. When an earthquake is detected in real time near your location, the app can send an automatic SMS and e-mails to a list of contacts with your precise position in space. This can be useful for rescuing without the need of user interaction with the app. You can also send a request of help or you can say that you are fine with just one click. The app also shows information on the earthquakes detected by the national and international seismic networks.
This app will provide us with real time location of people stuck in the disaster and will further use this location to provide proper authorities the location of the people who need saving. This is an attempt to save the majority of people who face the threat of post diastral deaths. 

Note that the information on earthquakes detected by national and international seismic networks is usually published with a delay ranging from a few minutes to many hours, depending on the seismic network. We aim to avoid this delay.
